# Features
- Keep track of your galleries and organize them more easily
- Search for galleries through title, artist or namespaces & tags
- Fetch metadata which includes namespace & tags from the web (Currently only supports g.e-hentai and exhentai) without getting you banned
- Favourite your favourite galleries and keep them in a seperate view
- View your galleries with high-quality thumbnails or in a simple table list
- Add your galleries easily without worrying about adding duplicates:
	+ Add a single detailed gallery. *Note: this way you can add even if the gallery already exist*
	+ Add galleries from different locations
	+ Or if you want it easy then just populate from a single folder containing all your galleries
- Can add galleries recursively, treating each subfolder as a gallery (applies to archives too)
- Currently only supports ZIP/CBZ and directories with loose files
- Keep track of on-going galleries and add new released chapters to your gallery easily
- Monitor 1 or more folders for events and be notified:
	+ Renaming a gallery source  will prompt the program to ask if you want to update the renamed gallery's source
	+ Deleting a gallery source will prompt the program to ask if you want to remove the gallery from the program as well
	+ Adding new gallery sources will prompt the program to ask you if you want to add them
- Customize your program with lots of options in the settings
- And lots more...
